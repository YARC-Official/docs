# Rock Band Stage kit
![stagekit.png](/stagekit/stagekit.png)
	The Rock Band Stage Kit was a licensed peripheral made by PDP (formerly known as Pelican Accessories) released on November 11, 2008 for the xbox 360. 
Consisting of a fogger, strobe light, and a colored led array consisting of 32 leds (8 of each red, yellow, blue, and green), it reads the light data of the in-game venue and translates that to real world effects. It supported Rock Band 1, Rock Band 2, and Rock Band 3 on xbox only.

YARG has added support for the Stage Kit and aftermarket Light Shows like the one from FatsCo.

## Venue Size
Venues themsevles are either "large" or "small". Some cues have different lighting patterns for each size.
## Venue Cues
Many songs have a 'venue' track which sets the current state of the fog machine, light array, and strobe machine. If the song is missing its venue track, YARG will automatically generate one for it at play time.
