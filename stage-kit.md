# Rock Band Stage kit
![stagekit.png](/stagekit/stagekit.png)
	The Rock Band Stage Kit was a licensed peripheral made by PDP (formerly known as Pelican Accessories) released on November 11, 2008 for the xbox 360. 
Consisting of a fog machine, strobe light, and a colored led array, it read the light data of the in-game venue and translated that to real world effects. It supported Rock Band 1, Rock Band 2, and Rock Band 3 on xbox only.

YARG has added support for the Stage Kit and aftermarket Light Shows like the one from FatsCo.

## Venue Cues
Many songs have a 'venue' track which sets the current state of the fog machine, light array, and strobe machine. If the song is missing its venue track, YARG will automatically generate one for it at play time.
