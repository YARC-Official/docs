# Rock Band Stage kit
The Rock Band Stage Kit was a licensed peripheral made by PDP (formerly known as Pelican Accessories) released on November 11, 2008 for the xbox 360. 

Consisting of a fog machine, strobe light, and a colored led array, it read the light data of the in-game venue and translated that to real world effects.
