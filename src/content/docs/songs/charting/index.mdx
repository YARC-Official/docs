Hello there!

Below is a list of style guidelines and conventions to follow when authoring charts for YARG. These guidelines are based on modern charting conventions and therefore differ from Guitar Hero and Rock Band charting style slightly, so please be sure to read all of the following guidelines thoroughly before starting work on your charts.

If you need help with preparing your chart for YARG or need anything in this guide clarified, feel free to ask for help in the YARG Discord server.

We hope to see your submissions soon!

# ðŸ§¶ YARN
YARN, short for Yet Another Rhythm Network, is a chart distribution service that allows all charters to make charts officially for YARG. Inspired by Rock Band Network, it is legally robust and is more direct than downloading from a separate site. Packs of YARN charts will be downloadable from the YARG Launcher Marketplace (for free!).
