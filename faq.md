# YARG
## ❔ What is YARG?
YARG (a.k.a. Yet Another Rhythm Game) is a free, open-source, plastic guitar game that is still in development. It supports guitar (five fret), drums (plastic or e-kit), vocals, and more!

## 🆓 Is YARG free?
✔ Yes! YARG is also open-source meaning that anyone can help make YARG better!

## 📥 How do I install and play YARG?
You can easily download it via the [YARC Launcher](/launcher)!

## 🏴‍☠ Does YARG stand for pirates?
❌ No. YARG stands for "Yet Another Rhythm Game," and has nothing to do with pirates or piracy. YARG does not support piracy as it is illegal. YARG does not use any ripped assets from any related games. If you download songs that aren't from the YARG [official setlist](/songs/Setlist), do so at your own risk.

## 🤝 How can I become a Contributor?
Check out the Building/Contributing section on our [github](https://github.com/YARC-Official/YARG) and join us on [discord](https://discord.gg/sqpu4R552r)!

## 📊 Where can I see what features are currently being developed or planned for YARG?
Check out our [issue tracker](https://yarg.youtrack.cloud/issues) or use the /roadmap command from the YARG discord bot!

## 🎵 What songs can I use in YARG?
We DO NOT support piracy, however, you can use song.ini with .mid and .chart, .sng, and unencrypted (RB) CON files.
You can also download our [official setlist](/songs/Setlist) and DLC packs from the [YARC Launcher](/launcher)!

## 💁‍ How do I support YARG?
YARG is open-source and is therefore free. If you have any programming knowledge or do art, please feel free to help out! If not, that's okay; just telling us that you enjoy the game is enough!

## 🎼 I have a band, and we want our song in YARG. How can we go about requesting it?
We have a Google Form that you can fill out, [here](https://forms.gle/cHWuGqzrFchgzZHU7). The charting team will vote for whether the song should be part of the main setlist, DLC, or if we reject it (as unfortunately we cannot accept all songs). We'll try to respond to you ASAP!

## 💡 I have an idea for YARG. Can I suggest it?
Of course! Feel free to pitch us the idea in our #suggestions channel on [discord](https://discord.gg/sqpu4R552r)!

# YARC Launcher
## 😵 If the game is YARG, why YARC Launcher?
Future-proofing. The YARC "Yet Another Rhythm Company" branding gives us an umbrella that can encompass more than YARG itself, should we eventually wish to distribute some other related software or another game entirely.

## 🏢 Is YARC a business?
❌ No. Despite the name, "Yet Another Rhythm Company" is not actually a company, corporation, or any sort of business.
