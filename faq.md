# YARG
## ❔ What is YARG?
YARG (a.k.a. Yet Another Rhythm Game) is a free, open-source, plastic guitar game that is still in development. It supports guitar (five fret), drums (plastic or e-kit), vocals, and more!

## 🆓 Is YARG free?
✔ Yes! YARG is also open-source meaning that anyone can help make YARG better!

## 📥 How do I install and play YARG?
You can easily download it via the [YARC Launcher](/launcher)!

## 🏴‍☠ Does YARG stand for pirates?
❌ No. YARG stands for "Yet Another Rhythm Game," and has nothing to do with pirates or piracy. YARG does not support piracy as it is illegal. YARG does not use any ripped assets from any related games. If you download songs that aren't from the YARG [official setlist](/songs/Setlist), do so at your own risk.

## 🤝 How can I become a Contributor?
Check out the Building/Contributing section on our [github](https://github.com/YARC-Official/YARG) and join us on [discord](https://discord.gg/sqpu4R552r)!

## 📊 Where can I see what features are currently being developed or planned for YARG?
Check out our [issue tracker](https://yarg.youtrack.cloud/issues) or use the /roadmap command from the YARG discord bot!

## 🎵 What songs can I use in YARG?
We DO NOT support piracy, however, you can use song.ini with .mid and .chart, .sng, and unencrypted (RB) CON files.
You can also download our [official setlist](/songs/Setlist) and DLC packs from the [YARC Launcher](/launcher)!

## 🖥️ What is the minimum hardware needed to run YARG?
YARG is not yet optimized, and fairly demanding in its current state. General guidelines:
- Anything with discrete NVIDIA: ok
- Meteor Lake (Core 7 Ultra 155H and up, Arc Xe LPG integrated GPU): ok
- Steam Deck or Ryzen Z1 (ROG Ally, etc.): ok, reported struggle with 4 players and vocals
- Radeon 780M: ok
- Intel Iris Xe: ok
- Radeon 760M or 680M: questionable
- Intel UHD: not recommended

## 💁‍ How do I support YARG?
YARG is open-source and is therefore free. If you have any programming knowledge or do art, please feel free to help out! If not, that's okay; just telling us that you enjoy the game is enough!

## 🎼 I have a band, and we want our song in YARG. How can we go about requesting it?
We have a Google Form that you can fill out, [here](https://forms.gle/cHWuGqzrFchgzZHU7). The charting team will vote for whether the song should be part of the main setlist, DLC, or if we reject it (as unfortunately we cannot accept all songs). We'll try to respond to you ASAP!

## 💡 I have an idea for YARG. Can I suggest it?
Of course! Feel free to pitch us the idea in our #suggestions channel on [Discord](https://discord.gg/sqpu4R552r)!

# YARC Launcher
## 😵 If the game is YARG, why YARC Launcher?
Future-proofing. The YARC "Yet Another Rhythm Company" branding gives us an umbrella that can encompass more than YARG itself, should we eventually wish to distribute some other related software or another game entirely.

## 🏢 Is YARC a business?
❌ No. Despite the name, "Yet Another Rhythm Company" is not actually a company, corporation, or any sort of business.

## 🏪 What is the YARC Launcher Marketplace?
The Marketplace is where official YARG song packs can be freely downloaded. This includes our main setlist, a variety of DLC, and even community creations submitted through YARN.

# YARN
## 🧶 What is YARN?
Yet Another Rhythm Network is our community chart-distribution service! Inspired by Rock Band Network, YARN allows charters to submit their own charts for distribution through the YARC Launcher Marketplace, so long as the music is properly licensed and the charts meet our standards and requirements. For more information, see the [Charting](/songs/charting) page.

# Weaver
## What is Weaver?
Weaver is our upcoming chart editing software. Initially announced as YACE - Yet Another Chart Editor - Weaver is meant to be a comprehensive tool for producing charts, incorporating all relevant features and instruments which YARG supports.

## Why the name 'Weaver'?
Two reasons: Firstly, it's evocative of REAPER, one of the more fully-featured packages for chart editing, and the one which was officially used when charting for Rock Band Network.

Secondly, it fits thematically with the name of our chart distribution service, YARN.
