# DMX
Digital multiplex with 512 pieces of information revision a, aka DMX512-A, is a protocol used to control lighting fixtures commonly found in theater and DJ equipment.

![3pinxlr.png](/dmx/3pinxlr.png =x300)![5pinxlr.png](/dmx/5pinxlr.png =x300)

DMX uses RS-485 serial communtions over 3 and 5 pin XLR connections to send and recieve the digital signals. Since a PC doesn't natively support these signals, YARG send DMX packets over a network connection using sACN to bundle the DMX data into a TCP/IP packet.

![fixtures.png](/dmx/fixtures.png =x300)

Then these sACN packets can be read by other devices and programs on the network as well as converters that can turn the packet back into raw DMX data, for the fixtures.

This flexiblity allows for unlimited possiblites in your YARG light shows!

# DMX Channels
Each of the  512 bytes, known  as channels,  in a DMX  packets  can hold a value from 0 to 255. YARG  will  set these values to indciate  various changes as follows:
|Channel Type Ledgend|||
|-|-|-|
|üê∂| Toggled| This channel will stay set at this value until set to another value|
|ü¶Æ| Note length| This channel will stay at this value until the note  ends, then set to 0
|üêï‚Äçü¶∫| Triggered| This channel will stay at this value for exactly one DMX packet, then set to 0
## Basic channels
Basic channels replicate the Rock Bane Stage  Kit.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Bitmath
A bitmath channel sums up total of the frets currently hit and sets that as the value. For example, if a guitar chord is red/green/yellow then the value of the channel will be red (4) + green (2) + yellow (8) = 14. The problem with trying to read this value in a DMX sequencer like lightjams is that, for example, you want to see if a red is pressed, you would need check if the channel value is 4 or 6 or 14 or 20 or 36, etc etc. This ends up with a huge list of statements that is hard to maintain and change when needed.

Each channel is one byte, which is 8 bits. Each bit can be a 1(on) or 0(off). If we think about each bit as having a decimal value we can understand the following:
||
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|bit 8|bit 7|bit 6|bit 5|bit 4|bit 3|bit 2|bit 1|
|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|
|128|64|32|16|8|4|2|1|
so in the above example would be shown as:
||
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|bit 8|bit 7|bit 6|bit 5|bit 4|bit 3|bit 2|bit 1|
|0|0|0|0|1|1|1|0|
|128|64|32|16|8|4|2|1|
|n/a|n/a|Open|Blue|Yellow|Red|Green|Open|

So instead of checking the decimal total, we can check which bits are set. If bit 3 is ever 1 we know this value has the red fret pressed!

Please note that while humans start numbering things at 1, a computer will start numbering things at 0. Each program does things different so be sure to double check what your program does. You might see the bits numbered like this:

||
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
Computers call it:|bit 7|bit 6|bit 5|bit 4|bit 3|bit 2|bit 1|bit 0|
Humans call it: |bit 8|bit 7|bit 6|bit 5|bit 4|bit 3|bit 2|bit 1|
Bits:|0|0|0|0|1|1|1|0|
decimal value:|128|64|32|16|8|4|2|1|
guitar fret:|n/a|n/a|Open|Blue|Yellow|Red|Green|Open|
