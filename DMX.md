# DMX
Digital multiplex with 512 pieces of information revision a, aka DMX512-A, is a protocol used to control lighting fixtures commonly found in theater and DJ equipment.

![stagelights.png](/dmx/stagelights.png)

DMX uses RS-485 serial communications over 3 and 5 pin XLR connections to send and receive the digital signals. Since a PC doesn't natively support these signals, YARG send DMX packets over a network connection using sACN to bundle the DMX data into a TCP/IP packet. These sACN packets can be read by other devices and programs on the network as well as converters that can turn the packet back into raw DMX data, for the fixtures.

This flexibility allows for unlimited possibilities in your YARG light shows!

# Quickstart guide using <a href="https://www.lightjams.com/">Lightjams</a>
Lightjams and QLC+ are both DMX sequencer programs that can read sACN packets, so they can be used to control DMX Light fixtures.
The following quick start template for Lightjams has all the default YARG DMX channels already setup and ready to go!

# Hardware Setup
A simple example of a harware layout with 20 channel fixtures. There are many options available for the sACN-to-DMX converter and fixtures.

A more advanced setup would have a DMX sequencer, either in between the PC and network or as a replacement for the converter.

# DMX Channels
Each of the  512 bytes, known  as channels,  in a DMX  packets  can hold a value from 0 to 255. YARG  will  set these values to indicate  various changes as follows:
|Channel Type Legend|||
|-|-|-|
|üê∂| Toggled| This channel will stay set at this value until set to another value|
|ü¶Æ| Note length| This channel will stay at this value until the note  ends, then set to 0
|üêï‚Äçü¶∫| Triggered| This channel will stay at this value for exactly one DMX packet, then set to 0
## Basic channels
Basic channels replicate the Rock Bane Stage  Kit.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Bitmath
A bitmath channel sums up the total of the frets currently hit and sets that as the value. For example, if a guitar chord is red/green/yellow then the value of the channel will be red (4) + green (2) + yellow (8) = 14. The problem with trying to read this value in a DMX sequencer like lightjams is that, for example, you want to see if a red is pressed, you would need check if the channel value is 4 or 6 or 14 or 20 or 36, etc etc. This ends up with a huge list of statements that is hard to maintain and change when needed. Instead we can check the bits.

Each channel is one byte, which is 8 bits. Each bit can be a 1(on) or 0(off). So if every bit is off (channel value 0) we get:
||||||||||
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
Bit name:|bit 8|bit 7|bit 6|bit 5|bit 4|bit 3|bit 2|bit 1|
Bits value:|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|

If we think about each bit as having a decimal value we can understand then we get the following:
||||||||||
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
Bit name:|bit 8|bit 7|bit 6|bit 5|bit 4|bit 3|bit 2|bit 1|
Bits value:|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|
Decimal value:|128|64|32|16|8|4|2|1|

So in the above example of a value of 14, we turn on the following bits to get that:
||||||||||
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
Bit name:|bit 8|bit 7|bit 6|bit 5|bit 4|bit 3|bit 2|bit 1|
Bits value:|0|0|0|0|1|1|1|0|
Decimal value:|128|64|32|16|8|4|2|1|
Guitar Fret:|n/a|n/a|Open|Blue|Yellow|Red|Green|Open|

So instead of checking the decimal total, we can check which bits are set. If bit 3 is ever 1 we know this value has the red fret pressed!

Please note that while humans start numbering things at 1, a computer will start numbering things at 0. Some programs use the 0 start, some use the 1 start so be sure to double check how your program does it. You might see the bits numbered like this:

||||||||||
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
Computers call it:|bit 7|bit 6|bit 5|bit 4|bit 3|bit 2|bit 1|bit 0|
Humans call it: |bit 8|bit 7|bit 6|bit 5|bit 4|bit 3|bit 2|bit 1|
Bit value:|0|0|0|0|1|1|1|0|
Decimal value:|128|64|32|16|8|4|2|1|
Guitar fret:|n/a|n/a|Open|Blue|Yellow|Red|Green|Open|

So if we turn every bit on we get 255, that is why that is the max value!
