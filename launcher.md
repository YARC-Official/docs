The YARC Launcher is the preferred way to download and update YARG, as well as its official setlist.

Download it from the GitHub: [https://github.com/YARC-Official/YARC-Launcher/releases/latest](https://github.com/YARC-Official/YARC-Launcher/releases/latest)

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

-   **1.**  Be sure Webview2 is properly installed.

In “Control Panel” → “Programs and features” check for “Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime”

The launcher relies on WebView2

Right click on it, select “Change”, and do a repair install.

-   **2.**  Be sure “Unblock” is **checked** in the launcher installer properties

Be sure “Unblock” is checked, here it is not checked.

-   **3.**  Be sure your anti-virus is not stopping the execution of the launcher or installer.
