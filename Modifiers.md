After picking a song to play, each player has the option of enabling various modifiers that will effect the note chart they're presented with.
Different play modes offer their own sets of modifiers:

Strums and Hammer-Ons/Pull-Offs are converted to Tap notes.
Useful if one doesn't want to strum anything, or to aproximate Keys gameplay.

## All HOPOs
