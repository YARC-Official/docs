###  ⚠️Note!

Since USB microphones are just input devices instead of being controllers, nearly all will work. If your computer detects it normally, you are ready to rock! However, if a microphone needs a speical driver that has to be installed before it will work, such as the Lips mics, it won't work with YARG.

###  🛠️Troubleshooting
❗Windows: If you are experiencing echo, make sure *Audio enhancements* are turned off.  Outside of YARG, check Windows' System / Sound / Properties / Microphone, and under Input settings, make sure *Audio enhancements* is set to **Off** instead of the default *Device Default Effects*.

❗Mac: YARG might not ask for mic access. Launch the .app manually instead of going through the launcher
